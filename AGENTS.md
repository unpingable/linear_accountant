# AGENTS.md — Working in this repo

This file is a **travel guide** for AI agents working on Linear Accountant, not a law.
If anything here conflicts with the user's explicit instructions, the user wins.

> Instruction files shape behavior; the user determines direction.

---

## Quick start

```bash
cargo build
cargo test                                  # 17 tests across 3 suites
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo fmt --check
```

There is no binary. This is a library crate others call.

## What this is

Linear Accountant is the reference boundary for the **Spendability Authority** role. It
conserves spendability: validity is contractible, capacity is linear. It mints and
consumes *capacity*; it does not judge validity, set budgets, or authorize action.

**Not** general agent safety. **Not** a policy engine. **Not** authorization. **Not**
persuadable. A turnstile, not a cathedral; a cash register, not a judge.

See [`README.md`](README.md) for the full framing and
[`docs/architecture/V0_BOUNDARY.md`](docs/architecture/V0_BOUNDARY.md) for authoritative
behavior.

## Repository layout

```
src/lib.rs                          The conserved core (single-writer, in-memory)
tests/v0_boundary.rs                Boundary properties
tests/file_write_workload.rs        WL-001: a real file write gated by the accountant
tests/contention_workload.rs        WL-002: concurrent consumers race one token
docs/architecture/                  Ratified design (V0_BOUNDARY, ROLE, HANDOFF_PACKETS)
docs/working/decisions/             Candidate, non-binding doctrine notes
docs/working/specimens/             Workload contact records (what each workload proved)
```

## Invariants

If one of these breaks, something is **wrong** — not "could be improved," wrong.

1. **No minting by the persuadable.** Only the accountant issues or consumes capacity.
   `TokenId` / `ReceiptId` have no public constructor; a proposer's vocabulary cannot
   express minting.
2. **Eligibility is contractible; capacity is linear.** The same valid eligibility
   reference, cited twice, must not yield two spends.
3. **Custody must not be silent.** Every event — grant, denial, consume, refusal,
   revoke, and the custodial `deposit` — is appended to the ledger with a body.
4. **The seam stays narrow.** Mint/consume decisions accept only sealed references and
   typed descriptors. No free-text justification field enters a decision. Free text in
   the seam reintroduces the thing the accountant exists to refuse.

## Coding conventions

- Rust 2021 edition. No external runtime dependencies (std only).
- Decisions are mechanical: timestamp / integer / set-membership / equality. Nothing
  parses a story. If a code path starts reasoning about *why*, it has become a judge —
  stop.
- Scope is matched by `==`, never containment. Any scope-hierarchy semantics belongs in
  the eligibility layer, never here.
- Caller-supplied logical time (`Tick`). No ambient `now()`.
- `cargo fmt` canonical; `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings` clean. Tests before
  commits — never claim tests pass without running them.

## Status claims

This crate is **frozen as a reference boundary**. The freeze is a claim with a basis:
17 passing tests, two bound workloads (WL-001, WL-002). No further crate slices without a
*consumer trigger* — a real agent stack wanting `consume()` at its tool-call dispatcher.

Long-lived docs rot when they carry too many roles at once. Design docs (`docs/architecture/`)
explain why/how the boundary is shaped; workload specimens (`docs/working/specimens/`)
record what contact proved; tests are the evidence. Don't promote a `working/` note into
`architecture/` until it is ratified, and move rather than clone when you do.

Use this repo's local vocabulary (spendability, eligibility, conservation, witness,
custody). Recognition rules travel between projects; vocabulary does not.

## Safety and irreversibility

### Do not do without explicit user confirmation
- `git init`, push to a remote, create/close PRs or issues
- Delete or rewrite git history
- Add runtime dependencies (this crate is std-only by design)
- Change a documented invariant or the public API of the frozen boundary

### Preferred workflow
- Small, reviewable steps; run `cargo test` + clippy + fmt before proposing commits
- New design surfaces get a candidate note under `docs/working/`, not an implementation

## Constellation

Linear Accountant is one role among several. It interfaces with — but does not subsume —
the others.

| Role | What it holds | Repo |
|------|---------------|------|
| Agent Governor | governs the request before it becomes spend (eligibility) | `agent_gov` |
| Wicket / WLP | admission gate / transport envelope | `wicket`, `wlp` |
| NQ | witness / testimony | `nq` |
| Nightshift | temporal operator / revalidation scheduler | `nightshift` |
| **Linear Accountant** | **conserves and consumes spendability (this repo)** | `linearaccountant` |

> NQ testifies. Nightshift times. Wicket admits. Linear counts. AG governs the request
> before it becomes spend.

## When you're unsure

Ask rather than guess, especially around:
- Whether a change opens a new surface (forcing case required) or finishes an
  already-opened one (completeness obligation).
- Anything touching the conservation key, the public API, or a documented invariant.
- Whether a workload is the *next deliberate slice* or scope creep.

## Agent-specific instruction files

| Agent | File | Role |
|-------|------|------|
| Codex / any agent | `AGENTS.md` (this file) | Start here |
| Claude Code | `CLAUDE.md` | Defers here; adds Claude-specific notes |
